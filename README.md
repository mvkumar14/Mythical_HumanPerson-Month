# Mythical_HumanPerson-Month
Description: A tool to interact with Frederick P. Brooks, Jr's Model of a "Man-month".

        (Metanote~> TODO: I need to look up the naming convention for a README
    Where should the description go, where should aims/ design go and so on
    Maybe design doesn't really go here, and I should create a seperate document for that
    Stick all the info here for now , and we'll sort it out later. )

Goal:
TLDR: I want a GUI for altering parameters, and an output visual that answers key questions in a scenario where the visual may be useful. The visual alone should be able to show the change in the state, not purely the new state, or the old state. 

The aim of this project is to provide a way to interact with the model of predicted time to project
completion discussed in the book "The Mythical Man Month" by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. The model 
is used to arrive at the conclusion that adding people to a project will always result in an extension
of the time it takes to complete the project. While this is true, it still may be valuable to calculate how long the extenstion is going to be for, and visualize how and why the extension will need to take place. The key questions that the graphic output of this system should be able to answer are: "Which initial assumptions were incorrect?", "What will we do now?", and "How will that affect the timeline?".  

This visual may be useful for companies during growth periods. Companies trying to grow explosivley, or sustain periods of growth may have projected growth. How fast that rate can increase is dependent on factors like how long it takes to train new people, how stable the tech stack is, how many people right now are productive, how many of them will need to be unproducitve in order to train new people. How long will it take them to become productive again? and so forth.  This model may be useful to help make more realistic decisions about the growth rate. It is very simplistic, but it may provide more realistic results compared to blind optimisim. Additionally this model may be used as a feedback mechanism. Providing more accurate projections as time goes on, and data is collected about time to complete tasks.
